Open-source, cross-platform, and feature rich iOS sideloading application. Supporting macOS, Linux[^1], and Windows[^2].

[^1]: On Linux, usbmuxd must be installed on your system. Don't worry though, it comes with most popular distributions by default already! However, due to some distributions [udev](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/udev.7.html) rules `usbmuxd` may stop running after no devices are connected causing Impactor to not detect the device after plugging it in. You can mitigate this by plugging your phone first then restarting the app.

[^2]: On Windows, [iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/106372) must be downloaded so Impactor is able to use the drivers for interacting with Apple devices.

## Structure

The project is seperated in multiple modules, all serve single or multiple uses depending on their importance.

| Module               | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/plumeimpactor` | GUI interface for the crates shown below, backend using wxWidgets (with a rust ffi wrapper, wxDragon).                        |
| `apps/plumesign`     | Simple CLI interface for signing, using `clap`.                                                                               |
| `crates/core`.       | Handles all api request used for communicating with Apple developer services, along with providing auth for Apple's grandslam |
| `crates/gestalt`     | Wrapper for `libMobileGestalt.dylib`, used for obtaining your Mac's UDID for Apple Silicon sideloading.                       |
| `crates/utils`       | Shared code between GUI and CLI, contains signing and modification logic, and helpers.                                        |
| `crates/shared`      | Shared code between GUI and CLI, contains keychain functionality and shared datapaths.                                        |
